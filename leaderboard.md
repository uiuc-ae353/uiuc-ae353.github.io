## Rules & Information

1. Rankings are based on the average of each student's successful runs (3 selected seeds)
2. Times are measured in seconds (s)
3. Only valid submissions that pass all test cases are included
4. Leaderboard tentatively updates daily at 9:30AM CST (unless something breaks our automated script).


## Notes

- Times are rounded to one decimal place. In case of ties, the next decimal place is used for tie-breaking
- No update on 10/12 because no submission passed the autograder. Manual grading happened on 11/12
